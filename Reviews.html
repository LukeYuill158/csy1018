                    <h2> Codepen Reviews- "9 reasons to use codepen" </h2>
                    
                    At CodePen.io, they describe themselves as a “playground for the front-end side of the web.” CodePen is great for testing out bugs, collaborating, and finding new inspiration. It works by allowing you to create “pens”, which are sets of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can then display those pens on your profile, take feedback, and continue to edit those pens at any time.
                    <br>
                    Like many live code playgrounds, CodePen lets you learn in an open-source environment, displaying a live preview of the code changes, and even letting you embed your CodePen demos on any web page, like the one below.
                    <br>
                    In this article I’ll go beyond those features just mentioned to explain some of the things that I think puts CodePen above its competition, and why you should check it out if you haven’t done so already.
                    <br>
                    While explaining these features, I’ll also embed some random but cool pens in each section for you to check out.
                    <br>
                    <h1>1. CSS Options</h1>
                    CodePen includes some awesome features to write CSS faster. You can select to include Normalize.css or Reset.css in your CSS by simply clicking a radio button. You can also choose to use -prefix-free or Autoprefixer as well. This way there is no need to take the time to link to an external file (which is also possible, if you wanted to).
                    <br>
                    What if you aren’t sure about some of your CSS techniques being used? Don’t worry; CodePen has CSSLint integration to search through your CSS code and warn you if there are errors, warnings, poor browser support, etc.
                    <h1>2. Flavors of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h1>
                    CodePen supports tons of flavors of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For HTML, you can use HAML, Markdown, Slim, or even Jade. For CSS, they support Sass and SCSS (both with an optional Compass or Bourbon add-on), as well as Less and Stylus.
                    <br>
                    Under the JavaScript menu, you can select CoffeeScript or LiveScript. There is also a drop-down menu where you can have the latest version of things like jQuery and AngularJS.
                    <h1>3. Emmet and Vim Binding</h1>
                    CodePen is all about faster and smoother development. That’s why they utilize toolkits such as Emmet to help keep projects moving. The CodePen editor allows you to use Vim Key Bindings which are command-line keyboard shortcuts. Both of these tools together can help to create a faster workflow.
                    <br>
                    To learn more about Emmet, you can check out the article Faster Workflow: Mastering Emmet.
                    <h1>4. Collections and Tags</h1>
                    You can add tags to your pens, which then become searchable. Searching tags such as “Loader” and “Form” brings up tons of helpful inspiration.
                    <br>
                    If you want, you can even create collections of pens relating to a certain topic. Chris Coyier, one of the co-founders of CodePen, has created collections such as “Path Drawing” and “Repeating Patterns“.

                    <h1>5. Different Pen Views</h1>
                    CodePen has a total 8 different views for pens. Each view has its own advantages.
                    <br>
                    Editor View – This is the default view for editing pens. You can adjust the size of the code previewer and select which languages to display.
                    <br>
                    Details View – This view allows you to see the pen’s tags, hearts, comments, forked pens, etc. This contains most of the social features for CodePen.
                    <br>
                    Full Page View – This is pretty self-explanatory. It makes your pen full-screen within an iframe, leaving only a CodePen footer.
                    <br>
                    Debug View – Debug View is a full-screen view, although with extra features. It removes the iframe and CodePen footer for easier JavaScript console access. This is great for testing code that you think CodePen might be interfering with.
                    <h1>6. CodePen Pro Views</h1>
                    If you are a CodePen Pro user, you have access to more views:
                    <br>
                    Presentation Mode – This mode is made especially for overhead projectors. It removes the header to give you more room and allows you to quickly change the font size and colors of the code editor. You can also change the size of the previewer without changing code.
                    <br>
                    Live View – With CodePen Live View, you have a full-screen display of your pen. As you edit that pen, it will automatically update as you type. This is often used when testing on multiple devices.
                    <br>
                    Professor Mode – This mode allows people to watch you code in real-time. There is also a chat window where the professor and students can chat.
                    <br>
                    Collab Mode – Collab mode allows more than one programmer to make edits to a pen at the same time. There is also a chat window, just like in professor mode.
                    <h1>7. Blogging</h1>
                    Blogging is a new feature on CodePen, allowing you to easily write about code just like on a regular blog.
                    <br>
                    You can write with Markdown, and use a special embedding tool to embed your pen when you need to. You can add custom CSS to your posts, and there is a super simple preview to test out your post.
                    <h1>8. Community</h1>
                    This is what sets CodePen ahead of the competition by a long shot. Community has been a huge part of CodePen since the beginning. Through comments and sharing, people can give and receive constructive criticism, and learn together. Groups such as 4ae9b8 and Bullgit have started from conversations through CodePen. The founders have talked about what they think about the CodePen community on the CodePen Podcast.
                    <h1>9. Inspiration</h1>
                    Impressive pens are always displayed on the homepage, as well as great articles and collections. Pens pose as both inspiration, and a fun way to learn. Searching through awesome pens can help improve your own work, and help improve your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                    Ultimately, utilizing CodePen can help you learn faster and become part of a large community. Articles on SitePoint often use CodePen to embed code for tutorials. And if you’re interested in more great features of CodePen, check out these:

                <h2> Last week we asked YOU some questions about Github - here are some of our favourite responses!</h2>

                <h1>Karen H wrote:</h1>
                "Great for sharing and storing code - an industry standard"
                
                <h1>What do you like best?</h1>

                I like how easy Github is to use and access plus it has integration with other systems and tools I use in my business. It was one of the first websites I started using for development when I was learning Git and learning the commands along with the system was fairly easy to get used to!

                <h1> What do you dislike?</h1>

                There was a slight learning curve but that is with any system. When I first started using Github there was no way to have a private repository without paying for a monthly subscription. Sometimes you just want to have a private repository for your own needs. Now with the new update private repositories are now free and if you need to have a team you can pay for better management.

                <h1> Recommendations to others considering the product </h1>

                Definitely, an industry standard set up an account and start pushing your code!

                <h1> What business problems are you solving with the product? What benefits have you realised?</h1>

                It helps me store the code I write for clients and access any necessary data points. It's nice to have in case I need to pull any information down to my local computer. Plus I can access it anywhere, also if I need to add anyone into a project I have that option. Also, most designers and developers are familiar with the program so they can quickly hop on!

                <h1> Syed Zainul A. wrote in and here's what he had to say</h1>

                "A complete open source experience on web"

                <h1> What do you like best? </h1>

                It's easy to onboard new developers into using git, and teach them our workflow process. GitHub Desktop makes it a lot easier to understand what's going on, and the repository history browser makes it really easy to see past code changes. It also enables us to quickly review all of the code that's being committed before it goes to production.

                <h1> What do you dislike </h1>

                Pricing can be a bit steep for users who are working on their own side projects. Users can host projects for free but they must be publicly visible.

                <h1> Recommendations to others considering the project </h1>

                GitHub is a great asset to any development team looking to keep their project safe, maintain high quality code and allow easy access from anywhere in the world.

                <h1> What business problems are you solving with the product? What benefits have you realised? </h1>

                We use GitHub to host our git repository, and all developers use GitHub Desktop to interact with it. It has made team collaboration really easy, fast and safe. We have a clear history of which user made which changes and why, which has made debugging a lot easier.
                <br>
                Being able to work on multiple features at once and fluidly merge them has been an extremely valuable asset to our team, since we're able to commit code with confidence. We're able to quickly create, publish and share new branches to work together, and also safely store our changes in case our computers are damaged.
